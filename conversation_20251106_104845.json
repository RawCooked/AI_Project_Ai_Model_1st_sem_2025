      "assistant": "I'd be happy to help with that. To \"kilogram the bread\" seems to be a translation error, but I think you might mean \"knead the bread.\" If that's correct, I can guide you through the process.\n\nTo knead the bread, start by placing the dough on a floured surface and pressing down on it gently with your hands. Fold the dough back onto itself, then push down and fold again, repeating the process for about 10 minutes. This helps develop the gluten in the dough, giving the bread its structure and texture.\n\nAs for resting the bread in soy sauce, I'm not sure that's a common practice in bread-making. Soy sauce is typically used as a seasoning or marinade, rather than an ingredient in bread dough. Could you clarify what you're trying to achieve with this step?\n\nAlso, I'd like to acknowledge the mention of \"萓曲\" (which I believe is a Chinese name) and \"Adelya\" - it seems like you're expressing gratitude on behalf of someone. If there's anything else I can help with, feel free to ask!",
